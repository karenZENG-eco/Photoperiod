Here are some of the major questions if you would like to give feedback (thanks btw :D ):

Which test graph is best?

Is the extra graph series or species graph series more useful?

Which extra/species graph is best?

How will printing of the phylo graph work? Is it useful?

NOTES
----------------------------------------
*Graphs are grouped by type, with multiple versions of all figures to compare.

*Black and white versions of graphs are denoted by "bw" at end of filename if applicable

*Higher resolution pdfs will be available once we decide which graphs are the best.

test graph:

Figure 1. a) Linear model and scatterplot of first flowering day for photoperiod sensitive 
(orange, n = 4459) and photoperiod insensitive (blue, n = 1904) species between 1960 and 2017. 

extra graph:

b) Boxplot/Violin plot of average change in first flowering day 
throughout the 56-year period, with each point representing a different species (n = 71).

species graph:

b) Linear Models of each species, with photoperiod sensitive 
(orange, n = 48) and photoperiod insensitive (blue, n = 23) species.

pie charts:

Figure 2. a) Pie chart of proportions of photoperiod sensitive (orange) and 
photoperiod insensitive (blue) species separated by life history with
perennials(left, n = 168) vs annuals(right, n = 91).

b)Pie chart of proportions of photoperiod sensitive (orange) and 
photoperiod insensitive (blue) species with woody species (left, n = 52) 
vs herbaceous species (right, n = 312).
phylo graph:

Figure 3. Photoperiod sensitivity data overlaid over a phylogenetic tree. 
Orange represents photoperiod sensitive species whereas blue represents 
photoperiod insensitive species (n = 419).
