** DONE Load Packages and base data
CLOSED: [2019-06-05 Wed 12:12]
*** DONE Is the data set correct?
CLOSED: [2019-06-05 Wed 12:12]
** DONE Ideally we want tibble with the variables
CLOSED: [2019-06-05 Wed 12:12]
- species
- avg_ffd: Average first flowering day (doy)
- photo: photoperiod sensitive (T/F)
- year: year of observation
- GF: Growth Form (H/W) (different script, below)
- LH: Life History (annual/perennial) (different script, below) 
*** DONE Issues:
CLOSED: [2019-06-05 Wed 12:12]
- multiple values in pp (should only be 1?)
- what's the correct source dataset?
** DONE Get Life History and Growth Form Data
CLOSED: [2019-06-05 Wed 12:13]
- Life history data (annual/perennial) from the TRY plant database  
- Growth form data (woody/herbaceous) was adapted from Zanne et al. (2009). 
- Species that could not be readily classified in to these groups were excluded from the relevant analyses
** TODO Effect of Photoperiod Sensitivity on First Flowering Date over time
*** TODO mixed effect generalised linear model
*** TODO photoperiod sensitive vs photoperiod insensitive
*** calculated the rate of change per decade by multiplying the slope of each line (the annual rate of change) by 10
*** We also fitted linear models to the combined dataset including both photoperiod sensitive and insensitive species to identify whether it made a significant difference over time (Appendix C) and to each species, extracting the gradient of the line to find their individual rates of advancement.
** TODO Phylogentic Analysis
*** Combine the photoperiod sensitivity data with the phylogenetic data using used the ‘phylosignal’ package
*** pruning the phylogenetic tree published by Zanne et al. (2014) using the ‘ape’ package
*** Phylogenetic signal and the significance of the signal was calculated using ‘phylo.d’ from the ‘caper’ package to find:
**** Frits D 
**** Purvis’ D
** TODO We performed chi-squared tests comparing photoperiod sensitivity with life history and woodiness using the ‘chisq.test’ command from base R (R Core Team, 2017).
